## The code   
This was our midcourse project at Craft Academy. We used two external API's to create a website where the user can searh for a cocktail and get the ingredients and instructions on how to make it. After that user can see all the options on alcholic beverage from a specific cocktail in System Bolaget store: brand, price, measurment etc.

### Setup   
To test this application, fork the repo to your own GitHub account and clone it to your local workspace. </br>
*Note:*Be sure to set up backend api first (noted above), in order to fully interact with the application. 
Install all of the dependencies:    
```
$ yarn install
```  
Start cypress and run the feature tests:  
```
$ yarn run cy:open
```
Start the backend api (if already configured) in a separate terminal (only run this command for the Rails application):

Start the React application and run it on your local host:
```
$ yarn start
